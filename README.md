I'm a beginner for machine learning, I just put all my projects here, to see how much improvement I can make along the way.

The first one: Movie rating prediction.
The challenges or learnings: 
1 dummy simple categorical data. OneHotEncode for binary data, 
2 how to find the most model and feature engineering method. Try gridsearchcv if you don't want to use your brain. But you have to try too many parameters in large range, too computationally expensive.
3 a deep understanding of the workflow, and it's not strictly fixed to follow the flow, feature engineering can happen at all phases of the flow.
4 a deep understanding of confusion matrix and evaluation metrics for classification, they are scary at first sight by their numbers, now I know the calculation of precision, recall and f1-score.
5 EDA is necessary for understanding the dataset. Check distribution of each feature and their correlations.
6 I tried LogisticRegression, KNearestNeighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and XGBoost, but not that familiar with all.
